# MANUsync
An android application that gathers data pertaining to production lines.

##Goals and Objectives
The goal of this project is to create an clean, intuitive and robust android application that will improve analytics of production lines.
This project strives to be as user friendly as possible to allow workers to use this application seamlessly as they move through a days
work. The UI/UX should be intuitive to all users, and should be clear enough that a user does not need a tooltip to understand
a feature.

Data from the application should be gathered, and stored in a way that is scalable. This means the application should have no issues
handling traffic from multiple users, and must be able to handle stressful periods when syncing data.

The main goal of this project is to present this data in a human readable, and familiar format to many average buisnessmen and businesswomen. To
ensure this, we will be using a very widespread format to display this data... a simple excel, or .csv file. In the future I hope to be able
to have a very nice web application to accompany this project that will allow managers to view the data from a website. The hope
is that this web application will be able to display real-time visual summaries, and updates of the data to allow a quicker, simpler form
of analytics.
